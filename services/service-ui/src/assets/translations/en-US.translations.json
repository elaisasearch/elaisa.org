As is known, a language can only be mastered if it is used regularly, ie it is used in a conversation or for reading appropriate literature. The problem with conventional learning materials is the outdated state of the respective texts. Textbooks often develop their own stories to explain the various topics of a conversation by means of self-contained stories. Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with actuality.",
